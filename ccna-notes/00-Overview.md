## 💡 Real-World Reflection Prompts

Use these questions at the bottom of each note you write:

> **💭 How would I apply this in a real job?**  
> **🛠 Could I configure this from scratch?**  
> **🚨 What would break if I misconfigured this?**  
> **📡 Where have I seen this used in real networks (YouTube labs, Cisco docs, etc.)?**  
> **🧪 Could I explain this to someone with zero networking experience?**
